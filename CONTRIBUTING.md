# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for considering contributing! This project is a portfolio piece, but improvements are welcome.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add feature"`)
4. Push the branch (`git push origin feature-name`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Development Workflow
- Run `docker compose up -d` for database
- Start backend (`server/`) and frontend (`client/`) separately
- Ensure code is clean and documented

## Coding Style
- Use ES modules in Node.js
- Use async/await, avoid callbacks
- React components should be functional with hooks
- Use Prettier/ESLint (if added)
